# Auth-Micro API
Auth-Micro API allows for easy integration of authentication services into applications. The process flow is simple: an adminUser plugs this auth service into their app by firstly registering an account; whereby a confirmation email will be sent to them. On confirmation, an API_KEY is given to them - this API_KEY will be signed with their unique ID which will be used to identify all requests to auth-microapi made from their app. Examples of requests made from their app to auth-microapi are registration and login of a new user on their app platform; these resgistration and login requests will be authorized and granted authentication if they are sent with the adminUser's API_KEY, thereby creating a guestUser on their app which is stored in the adminUser's database collection.
